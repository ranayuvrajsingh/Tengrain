            Research and development is pivotal to the provision of quality
            inputs required to boost productivity, increase income and
            consequently improve livelihoods while ensuring all-year round
            availability of food. Therefore, we encourage researches that
            produce more adaptive and resilient crops that are highly nutritious
            and environmentally safe.
            <br />
            <br />
            in contributing to improving the livelihoods of food producers, we
            provide stakeholders with vital information, create awareness on
            rising trends and issues and organize training for skills upgrading.
            We also facilitate the availability of latest technologies required
            to drive efficient processes within the industry.
            <br />
            <br />
            With our presence across different countries and continents
            including the United Kingdom, India, and Africa, we are committed to
            building sustainable communities. Also, focused on the need to
            produce food for future generations, we work and partner with
            organisations that share similar interests in global agricultural
            development.
